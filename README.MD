# OVERVIEW
AI-powered carbon footprint analyzer integrated with Instagram. Creating real and effective change amongst generation X.

At team InstaCO2, we aim to deliver the most impactful change in the shortest amount of time. 

# THE BACKGROUND
In todays age, we are inundated with information on how we can each make a positive change to ourselves and the environment we live within. Whether is be top ten lists of saving energy in the home to government endorsed ways to lower your carbon footprint. Furthermore target penetration is a key problem for campaigns that aim to raise awareness and change behaviour.

# OUR GOAL
At InstaCO2 we sought to solve the above problems, by parsing through government data, NASA provided data and academic papers to understand the real equivalence of our actions on the environment around us. Does using a reusable bag have the same impact of taking the train over the car? Does eating less meat or conserving water have a greater impact. So instead of trying to make many small changes, what if we could have a far greater impact by directing our energy towards our behaviours that generate the largest carbon footprint.

That is where InstaCO2 comes in. We have done the data analysis and number crunching to deliver an incredibly simple and low-touch user experience that provided instant gratification in the form of a carbon footprint analysis of your instagram feed. With only the click of one single button you can immediately get a fun and informative analysis of your own impact, all built upon an artificial intelligence engine.

# THE STACK

We built our app using the Node JS runtime environment and leveraged Express to host our server.
On the front end we chose React to manage the front end DOM and Material UI for styling.
We were inspired by previous years implementations of Clarifai and wanted to try it out - this was our AI engine.

# RESULT
We are incredibly excited to present InstaCO2 to you. We strongly believe that reaching the audience that does not naturally seek out ways to make a positive change is the the best way to generate a larger galactic impact.
